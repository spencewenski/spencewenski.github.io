Hello!

My name is Spencer. I am studying computer science at the University of Michigan. When I’m not busy with schoolwork, I am generally reading, running, programming, brainstorming for the game I’m designing, or binge-watching my latest Netflix addiction.

I started this blog to work on my writing and share my thoughts and experiences related to my various interests.

Feel free to say hello on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spencewenski) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/spencewenski)!
