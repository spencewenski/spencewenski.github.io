Welcome!

My name Spencer, and this is my blog. You might be wondering, "Who are you," "What is this place," or "Why am I here?" Well, I don't know why you're here (maybe someone is forcing you to read this at gunpoint? (blink twice for yes and once for no)), but I do know who I am and what this place is:

I am studying computer science at the University of Michigan. When I'm not busy with schoolwork, I can generally be found running, reading, playing video games, working on a side project, or binge-watching my latest Netflix addiction.

And this place is something I've created as a space where I can share my thoughts and experiences related to my various interests, some of which I mentioned above. There's no real structure or plan, more a general sense of what you might call organized chaos. Or you might not call it that. I don't know. The point is, some things will be serious, some silly, some might be weird, and I invite you to join me. If you want. No one's forcing you to read this, and even if they are, I can't help you, no matter how many times you blink.

Anyway, feel free to say hello on [Twitter][twitter-link] or check out my projects on [GitHub][github-link]!
