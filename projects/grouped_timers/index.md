Grouped Timers for Pebble
=========================

A timer app that allows you to group timers into lists. Timer groups can be set
to automatically progress through the list, starting each timer after the
previous one finishes.

## Sample use cases
- At work I have a sit-stand desk. I have a group with two timers, 15 and 45
minutes, to remind me to switch between sitting and standing. The next timer
automatically starts when I stop the previous timer so I don't forget to start
it. Before I had this app, I almost always forgot to start the next timer.

- I also use it for timing planks. I have another group with two timers, 1
minute and 5 seconds. I do a plank for 1 minute and then I have 5 seconds to
switch to the next plank position. In this group, the next timer starts
automatically without me needing to interact with the watch.

- Similar to the previous, I also use it for timing stretches. 30 and 5 seconds.
Stretch for 30 seconds, switch to next position for 5 seconds, then stretch
again for 30 seconds. The next timer automatically starts without input just
like in the previous.

- I also have a group that has a bunch of one-off timers for when I'm cooking.
In this group the timers don't progress automatically to the next one, so it's
really good for having multiple timers running at the same time.

- Did I mention there's no hard-coded limit to the number of timers you can
create? The official timer only lets you create eight timers! Crazy!
