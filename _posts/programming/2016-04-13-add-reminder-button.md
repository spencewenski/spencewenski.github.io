I used to use Google reminders all the time, but I haven't recently because I
became infuriated by the totally inefficient and tedious process of getting to
the add reminder page of the Google app (four whole taps!). There has to be a
better and faster way to create reminders, ideally with a single tap. Luckily,
I'm a developer (though not a very experienced Android developer, if I'm being
honest), so even if Google can't provide the ideal experience, I can create it
for myself.

The easiest and probably simplest solution to my problem is to create a stub app
that just opens the Google app with the query 'add reminder'. So, that's exactly
what I did. The full project can be found on GitHub [here][project-url], and
here's the code for the main activity:

{% highlight java %}
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    public static final String ADD_REMINDER = "add reminder";

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        launchGoogleSearch(ADD_REMINDER);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        launchGoogleSearch(ADD_REMINDER);
    }

    /**
     * Launch a Google Search activity with the given query
     *
     * If the query starts with 'http' or 'https', launches a search in a web browser;
     * otherwise, Google search will be applied
     *
     * https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_WEB_SEARCH
      */
    private void launchGoogleSearch(String query) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_WEB_SEARCH);
        intent.putExtra(SearchManager.QUERY, query);
        startActivity(intent);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
