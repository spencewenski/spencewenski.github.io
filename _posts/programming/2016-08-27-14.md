When researching how to save data for the game I'm working on, I found a couple
solutions, namely Unity's built-in [PlayerPrefs][player-prefs] and the paid
plugin [Easy Save][easy-save]. However, I needed something more powerful than
PlayerPrefs and I couldn't justify spending $30 on Easy Save. Therefore, I
decided to implement my own [save manager][save-game].

My save manager has a few improvements over PlayerPrefs:

- Data is obfuscated when written to disk
- Entire classes can be saved/loaded by defining a conversion to and from a
	serializable version of the class (e.g. implementing ISaveable)
- Data can easily be fetched using the ID of desired object
- Save any serializable type, not just int, float, and string


In addition, my implementation has some advantages over Easy Save (I think; I'm
not that familiar with Easy Save):

- It's free!
- It's extremely easy to add support for custom classes
