I use [Wunderlist][wunderlist] to quickly write down ideas and random thoughts
that come to me throughout the day. These little notes go to my Wunderlist
Inbox. Later, I go through the Inbox, completing items and/or sorting them into
my main [task management system][trello]. This often requires copying multiple
list items, which can be slow and tedious because Wunderlist doesn't provide a way to copy the text of
an item to the clipboard, so I end up needing to open items and copy their text
one at a time. In order to improve this process, I created a Chrome extension
that allows you to copy selected list items to the clipboard. The extension is
available on Github [here][project-url].
