In my last semester at the University of Michigan, I took EECS 494, Computer
Game Design and Development. For the final project, my team created a game
called Vision.

Here's the logline for the game:

> Vision is a first person puzzle platformer in which you use sound guns to see and interact with the environment. You can use these guns to push things around, turn things into trampolines, control gravity, and even fly through the air. Compete with your friends to see who can get the best time!

And here's the trailer:

The game is open sourced! The code can be found [here][vision-github-link].

I had a lot of fun creating this game with my team. It was an amazing
learning experience for programming with Unity and project management.

If you play the game, let me know what you think! Windows and Mac builds can
be found [here][vision-download-link].
