*This is the first in a series of posts on important aspects of game design. In each, I answer the question in the general case, then discuss some specific examples from games that I’ve played.*


One might think that making a game challenging is counter-intuitive, “I want it to be easy so I can win!” Well, that’s one way to think about it, but allow me to explore the opposing viewpoint.

In life, one encounters many challenging things: school, interviews, competing in athletics. Sure, these things are difficult, but we don’t do them just for the challenge; we do them for the sense of accomplishment and any accompanying rewards (diploma, job, or medal, respectively) that come with the completion of the challenge.


So it is with games. They’re not challenging just for the sake of being difficult, they’re challenging to engender in the player a sense of accomplishment and self-satisfaction upon the completion of a level, challenge, or the entire game. It is this sense of accomplishment that the game designer hopes to instil in the player, and challenging gameplay is one of the ways this can be achieved.


### Minesweeper
Take Minesweeper, for example. Minesweeper looks like an incredibly simple game, and it is, but solving a board quickly takes a lot of practice and strong reasoning skills. This challenge, in spite of the relatively simple mechanics, makes Minesweeper fun. Now, I’m not saying it’s the most fun game ever, but the satisfaction of solving a large board can be almost tangible. And when you lose, the defeat feels all too real, as well.

### Beyond: Two Souls
On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have [Beyond: Two Souls][bts-wikipedia]. B:TS is a triple-A produced game with a star-studded cast (it stars Ellen Page and William Dafoe). All sources would indicate that B:TS should be stunning (and it is, in a lot of ways). However, it fell short of my expectations. The gameplay is so ridiculously simple, I’m pretty sure it’s literally impossible to fail any of the missions. The game plays more like an eight hour movie, where the player has a small amount of control over what the characters say. The game is so easy, that you might as well just watch a playthrough on YouTube; the experience is nearly identical. But I digress. The point is, even if a game is very good in a lot of ways, if it isn’t challenging enough, it can be difficult to keep the player engaged.

### Give Up
A game can also be *too* difficult. This doesn’t happen very often, but when it does, the results are very polarizing. On the one hand, the game is extremely engaging, and the player feels a strong desire to improve his skills enough to beat the game. On the other hand, the game can be so absurdly difficult that the player becomes so frustrated that he “[rage quits][rage-quit-link]”. I think the best example of this is a game appropriately named [Give Up][give-up-link] (try it, and if you can make past level 25 without swearing, then you're a better person than me). In this case, it’s okay that the game is so difficult and frustrating because that’s exactly what the designer intended. In the general case, however, it’s a problem if a game is so difficult that the player would rather give up than continue playing.
