Let’s talk (read: rant) about winter running and why it’s the worst.

First, it’s cold out there! In the summer you can run in shorts and often shirtless. Try that during a Michigan winter and you’ll die!! Okay, you might not die, but you’ll be very uncomfortable. So you put on your running tights, dry-fit, windbreaker, hat, and gloves, and you’re usually ready to go. Most days, this is sufficient; you get out on your run and it really doesn’t feel that cold. However, you still had put on all those stupid layers just so you don’t freeze on your run. Plus, there are days where it get ridiculously cold outside, like below 0F windchill cold. It’s days like that that I hate the most; I put on an extra jacket, another pair of gloves, and maybe even a [neck gaiter](http://www.bulabula.com/product/typhoon-therma-fleece-neck-gator-2/).

Second, the stupid snow is everywhere! Okay, it’s not everywhere, but it is on a large part of my favorite routes. Let me back up: during the non-winter months, I design all these great running routes and I log a bunch of great times on them. Then, all of a sudden, they’re all covered in snow. The snow makes the footing uneven and slippery, so it’s basically impossible to run my normal pace on those paths. If I want to run at a decent pace, I have to modify my routes to avoid paths that aren’t sufficiently cleared of snow. This isn’t the end of the world, I know, but it is difficult to find enough clear paths to construct a route for a 10+ mile long run.

Okay, now that that’s out in the open, I suppose I should offer a counterpoint: you’ll never be too hot on a run during the winter. And I suppose that’s true, but there are only a few days a year that are _too_ hot, and even then, I’d prefer to be sweating like crazy than freezing. That’s why spring and fall are the best times of the year for running. Not too hot, not too cold, and (usually) no snow!
