So, back in October-ish of last year, I registered for the [Ann Arbor half-marathon][aa-marathon-website]. At the time, I was thinking, "Hey, I have six whole months to train for this thing, I'm going to train *so* hard and rock the socks off of the race." Well, that went okay for a month or two, but I escalated my training too quickly and ended up injuring myself. It wasn't anything serious, but it did force me to back off a bit in my training. That injury, combined with my increasingly busy schedule, caused my training to be very inconsistent; I would sometimes not run for an entire week, compared to my usual six or seven.

I have since recovered from said injury and, as there there are only about six weeks until race day, am working really hard to be more consistent with my training. Here are some things I do that help me stay on track:

### Set a mileage goal
Every week I try to run a certain number of miles. This helps keep my workout plans honest and gives me a general metric for how my training is going. As my training progresses, I expect my weekly mileage to steadily increase and eventually plateau. This plateau usually occurs at around the 40-50 miles/week mark.

### Plan workouts
Back in January, I set up a rough training plan for the three months leading up to race day. This helped me get a sense of what I needed to do in order to be ready for race day. A typical week of the plan includes a long run on Sunday, a hill workout on Tuesday, and a [tempo run][tempo-run-link] on Thursday, and recovery runs on every other day. Over the course of the plan, the intensity and/or length of these workouts increase, until I am (hopefully) ready to race.

### [Stick to the plan][leeroy-video]
I try follow my plan as closely as possible; it's okay if I slip a little or push a workout back, but only if I have a good reason, like below-zero temperatures or snow storms (you try running 5-10 miles through five inches of snow). As long as I can get all my workouts in and my mileage is about what I wanted it to be, I consider the week a success.

### Stay healthy
This is the most important part. When I get injured I usually have to take days or weeks off at a time. This is, obviously, very bad for consistency, and is why I tend to error on the side of caution in my training. In the end, it's better to back off a bit and be a little out of shape than over train and be injured on race day.
