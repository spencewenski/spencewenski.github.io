When I was middle school and high school, my English teachers always told me, "Show, don't tell." I see this everywhere in good story telling, and it's especially apparent in video games. Unless the game is text based, it excels at showing you what everything looks like (it is a *video* game, after all). As a result, video games can take this phrase one step further, into the realm of "[conceal, don't feel][frozen-video]". Wait, no, that's not right. How about "engage, don't show."
